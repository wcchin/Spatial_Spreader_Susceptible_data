# The data and calculation results for the spatial super-spreader and susceptible analysis

This repository is prepared for storing the raw data, processed data, supporting files, and analysis results for the paper **Identifying spatial super-spreader and spatial super susceptible locations from human movement networks**. 



The directories of the data is organized as follow:

- a_raw_data: the downloaded, unprocessed zip files from the LTA datamall open data API,
- b_processed_data: the data after preprocessing and preparation for analysis, 
- c_supporting_data: include the basic statistics, administrative boundary files, and the location info for bus stops and train stations, 
- d_result: the calculation results corresponding to the steps in the paper.
